<p>A great place to start your acedemic career is by contacting your advisor. Your acedemic advisor is going to be your greatest resource. However if it is too early to contact your advisor
you can start planning your courses at Washington University<a href= "https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/CourseListings/Semester/Listing.aspx">Course Listings</a>. It is also fun to just look for
interesting courses you might take for fun!</p>
<br>
<p>Another valuable resource for you is webstac. This is how you manage all your classes and build your schedule. Your advisor will
walk you through how to do this. You will also be able to access your grades and your housing appointments on webstac. </p>

<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Finding a Major and/or Minor.</h3>
<p>Finding a major or minor can be very hard. It takes a lot of commitment to finally choose and takes most people over a year.
However if you are taking the time to choose a major it can be very helpful to visit the sites of your department of interest. If
you are interested in computer science we have a site already available to you <a href= "<a href= "http://williamlyons.github.io/directoryStart">here</a>. Many of the
schools at washington university have specific major programs that are readily avialable on thier websites.</p>
<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Help.</h3>
There are many ways to get help at WashU. A great way to get help is by going to  <a href= "https://cornerstone.wustl.edu/">Cornerstone</a>. This organization is located on the South Forty
and specializes in helping students succeed. They have tutors and specialized study groups tailored to your needs. If you are a member of the engineering school
Engineering Student Services can help as well. If you have specific questions we encourage you to email your dean or acedemic advisor.
